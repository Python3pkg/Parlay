## Full Documentation

See the [wiki](https://github.com/PromenadeSoftware/Parlay/wiki) for the complete documentation. 


## Installation

Parlay requires Python 2.7 to be installed.  This is included on OSX and Linux.  Windows users can install python [here](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.11/python-2.7.11.amd64.msi).  For Windows users who already have Python 2.7 installed, it is recommonded to upgrade to the latest version (2.7.11), especially since it includes the python package manager "pip".

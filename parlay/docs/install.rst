Parlay is written in the Python programming language, for full
cross-platform compatibility. As such, Parlay requires Python 2.7 to be
installed your computer, as well as several python libraries.

-----------------------------

If you are installing Parlay on a Windows PC, you will need to install
Python 2.7 if you do not already have it. If you are running Linux or
OSX, python is already included on your machine.

!!!WARNING: CHANGE THESE KEYS FOR SECURE COMMUNICATIONS!!!

THESE files are the SSL keys used by the Broker for secure connections. 

Given that these keys are the default and the private keys are publicly handed out
THEY ARE NOT SECURE. You *MUST* change these if you want secure comminucations in Parlay

All keys labeled broker.* are used by the broker. Keys labeled remote.* are used by the broker for remote communication (e.g. remote service applications where the broker is a client)

here is ane xample of how to generate keys:

openssl genrsa -out server.key 2048
openssl req -new -key server.key -out server.csr
openssl x509 -req -days 3650 -in server.csr -signkey server.key -out server.crt
openssl x509 -in server.crt -out server.pem
